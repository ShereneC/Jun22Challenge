          Apples are produced by an apple tree. They are squished really hard at the peak of ripeness to make yummy
          yummy apple juice. Peak sugar concentration develops in rhythm with the last blood moon of the fall equinox.
          Do not pick them too early as you <b>risk poisoning yourself</b> from the concentration of <b>cyanide</b> that
          makes its way
          from the apple flesh into the seed at peak ripeness. This is why you may have gotten a belly ache from eating
          apples as a youngster - young bodies cannot filter out the cyanide of apples as efficiently as adults -
          <b>protect your children from unripe apples!</b>
          Apples are the famous fruit that invented gravity via Isaac Newton - according to legend. I mean, who ever
          heard of a raspberry or a kiwi falling on your head? <b>Give all due respect to the Mighty Apple</b> and it
          will
          provide you with tantalizing apple juice or cider for eons to come!
